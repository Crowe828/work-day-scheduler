# Work Day Scheduler

A calendar application that allows the user to save events for each hour of the day. This app will run in the browser and feature dynamically updated HTML and CSS powered by jQuery and moment.js.

## How It Works

```
  * When the user view the timeblocks, each timeblock is color coded to indicate whether it is in the past, present, or future
  * When the user clicks into a timeblock they can enter an event
  * When the user clicks the save button for that timeblock the text for that event is saved in localStorage
  * When the user refreshes the page the saved events persist
```
